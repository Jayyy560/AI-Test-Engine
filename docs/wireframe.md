# Autonomous AI Test Engineer – Wireframe

The initial release focuses on the Admin / Core Team dashboard and mirrors the provided reference layout. The structure is organized into four vertical bands that adapt responsively.

1. **Global Shell**
   - Persistent top bar with product identity, contextual tabs, and a primary "Configure" action.
   - Light gradient background framing the dashboard canvas.

2. **Hero + KPI Strip**
   - Eyebrow label and supporting copy introducing the dashboard.
   - Row of four KPI cards (System Health, Tests Passed, Failures, Avg Duration). Each card presents a headline value, delta note, and status icon.

3. **Insight Panels**
   - Left: "Coverage Metrics" card with stacked progress bars for code / endpoint / UI coverage percentages.
   - Right: "Failure Statistics" card listing failure categories with colored pills and counts.

4. **Operational Panels**
   - Left: "Duration Timeline" card summarizing execution duration trends.
   - Right: "Admin Capabilities" list of actionable settings presented as stacked buttons.

The layout keeps generous spacing (24px grid) and soft shadows to echo the reference aesthetic while remaining simple enough for iteration.
